So [Nubbles](/nubbles) has finally been released on the Apple App Store!

Yay!

Thanks to libGDX and RoboVM the process was pretty painless, a silly mistake on my part meant it had to go through review twice.

As an experiment there are two versions, a free version with ads, and a paid version with no ads.
