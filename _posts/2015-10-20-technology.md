excerpt: On moving from libGDX to Phaser
---

So, my previously released game [Nubbles](/nubbles) was built using [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), written in Java. There were a lot of things I liked about using libGDX, and some things I didn't. One of the things that always annoyed me was that I couldn't use my Chromebook to work on games, I have other machines, but my Chromebook is the most portable. So I looked into HTML5 game engines, something I could write anywhere, deploy on mobile but test in a browser.

After playing with a few, I settled on [Phaser](http://phaser.io/). It has excellent documentation and examples, both of which were easily accessible offline (yes I know, Chromebook, offline, random). After working up a prototype for a new game idea (Square Next, more on that later) I decided I wasn't keen on using plain JavaScript to develop, being used to Java I kind of missed some of the OO mechanics, and wasn't keen on trying to implement or work around them in JavaScript. So I found TypeScript and thought I'd give that a go. Some seven months later and I've finished the project, written entirely in TypeScript, using Phaser to do all the heavy lifting.

Some things worked well, some things were a pain.

Being able to develop on pretty much anything with a web browser kind of went out the window, because I needed NodeJS to transpile the TypeScript back into JavaScript. This meant I could still use the Chromebook (Crouton is a marvellous thing), but couldn't for example use an Android tablet (which tbh is probably not really an issue, I just like being able to develop on any device that I own for some reason).

I have to admit to liking TypeScript, it gives you the freedom of JavaScript, but adds in some of the safety of a strongly typed language like Java. Mind this seemed to lead to a hybrid style where I ended up with some typed and some non-typed variables, probably depending on my mood at the time.

Debugging wasn't as bad as I thought it would be thanks to auto generated source maps and the Chrome debugger.

Using Grunt as a build tool meant I could just write code, save and then switch to a browser to see the results immediately.

The difficult part came when trying to get things working on Android...I started with CocoonJS, but having to upload a new file each time to be built in the cloud got annoying. I tried the command line version, but that just seemed to be using Cordova anyway. As I'm not really using any snazzy graphics I figured I may as well just use straight Cordova. Once I'd started down this route, things got easier, although I never did figure out a satisfactory way of integrating the Cordova parts into source control.

The final release of [Square Next?](/square-next) used Cordova for iOS and Cocoon for Android.

Next time I'll talk about moving away from Phaser....fickle, moi?


Many Thanks,
