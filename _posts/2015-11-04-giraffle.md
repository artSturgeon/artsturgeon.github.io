title: Technology change, again
excerpt: On moving from Phaser to HaxeFlixel, plus Enter The Giraffle
---

So previously I wrote about switching technologies from [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) to [Phaser](http://phaser.io/). This worked fine for [Square Next?](/square-next), as it isn't very performance intensive. But when prototyping a new idea, I ran into some problems.

Using Cordova was fine for iOS, but the only way I could get decent performance on Android was using CocoonJS. Not too bad, as CocoonJS was free, but they recently switched to a different pricing model (and a different name - Cocoon.io), i.e. one where you have to pay actual money. To be fair you can still have two projects for free, but anything more than that starts to get expensive (esp. for a hobby dev with no actual budget). Plus the workflow isn't great, I don't like having to wait on cloud compilers.

So, back to the drawing board.

Enter [Haxe](http://haxe.org/), or more specifically [HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com/).

I'd briefly played with HaxeFlixel before, after moving on from Flash and ActionScript, but never finished anything. Plus the Haxe landscape is confusing, OpenFL, NME, Lime?
I decided to give it another shot though, and a new install went fairly smoothly.


### Enter The Giraffle


So, unbeknownst to you, gentle reader, I sneakily released a little something onto the Play Store when you weren't looking.

It's called Giraffle, and it came about after a totally random conversation. I made the inital Phaser version in a weekend, but then ran into the aforementioned performance issues. So, looked like a perfect candidate for a re-write with HaxeFlixel.

It went okay, the biggest problem was dealing with a different co-ordinate system.

The Android version was re-released with no noticeable difference to you, but a totally different technology stack. And I now have an iOS version to play with too.

So going forward I think I'll be using HaxeFlixel, lets see how it goes.

In the meantime, go and have a play with Giraffle:
