excerpt: Jam devlog entry 1

I have entered my first jam!

[The libGDX jam](http://itch.io/jam/libgdxjam)

I'll be posting in the forums on itch.io [here](http://itch.io/jam/libgdxjam/topic/12178/arthur-scotts-devlog).

And on here, mostly duplicates I would imagine.

​Right so, had a thought shower last night and came up with some ideas. Life in Space is a good theme, and with Tim Peake in the news a lot at the moment, I wanted to create something with the ISS in it.
I often struggle with creating fully fleshed out ideas so I wanted to get a fair amount sorted up front.
A game isn't really a game until it has play/win/lose states.


So my idea is thus:


The International Space Station is floating through space, constantly orbiting the Earth, in its path is a load of space junk! Your mission is to clear the path for the ISS. Hence:


**Space Sweeper**


The ISS has a laser cannon mounted on it to clear debris, which you can control with the keyboard.

Also you'll need to send out intrepid astronauts to collect fuel/power ups/special treats, you'll control them with the mouse.

If the ISS takes too much damage, or all your astronauts are killed, game over.

Score based, with increasing difficulty levels - more junk!



I've created a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/artSturgeon/spacesweeper​), but there isn't much in there yet.

I'll be using Kotlin and Ashley, so first task is to set up Gradle/IntelliJ for Kotlin compilation, and get a couple basic systems in there. Then I'll use Inkscape to create some initial mock ups and basic graphics.

Many Thanks,

art
