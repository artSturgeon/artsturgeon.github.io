title: Squirl is released!
excerpt: Another game released on the App store!

Another release - this time an iOS (iPhone) exclusive!

The first pic is one of the original prototype images, before much work had been done on the game. The other two are the title screen and an in-game shot from the released version.

It seems to take me about 6 months to finish a game no matter the scope (apart from Space Sweeper, I think having a one month deadline was a good thing!).

Talking about scope, it was all over the place with this one. I think in future a fully working prototype is in order before committing to a project!

Written in Kotlin, using libGDX, Ashley, RoboVM for compilation.

All graphics created in Inkscape and GIMP.

Music created in Sunvox, original tune by [Clockwork Mitten](http://clockworkmitten.com).

Available now on the iOS App Store!

Download, play, and tell your friends!


Many thanks,
