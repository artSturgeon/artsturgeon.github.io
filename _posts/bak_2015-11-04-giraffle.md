So previously I wrote about switching technologies from Libgdx to Phaser. This worked fine for Square Next, as it isn't very performance intensive. But when prototyping a new idea, I ran into some problems.

Using Cordova was fine for iOS, but the only way I could get decent performance on Android was using CocoonJS. Not too bad, as CocoonJS was free, but they recently switched to a different pricing model, ie one where you have to pay actual money. To be fair you can still have two projects for free. Also the workflow isn't great, I don't like having to wait on cloud compilers.

So, back to the drawing board.

Enter Haxe, or more specifically HaxeFlixel.

I'd briefly played with HaxeFlixel before, after moving on from Flash and ActionScript, but never finished anything. Plus the Haxe landscape is confusing, OpenFL, NME, Lime? But a new install went fairly smoothly, and given that HaxeFlixel is based on Flixel which was written by Rich <Davey> creator of Phaser, there are plenty similarities.

Enter The Giraffle

So, unbeknownst to you, dear gentle reader, I sneakily released a little something onto the Play Store when you weren't looking.
