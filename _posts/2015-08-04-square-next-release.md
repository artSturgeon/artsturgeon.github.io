New release shocker!

My second game, Square Next, is now live on the Play Store!

It's an action puzzler where you need to complete the letter or number sequences within the time limit.

It's taken about 7 months to finish, which is probably ridiculous considering the original prototype was done in an evening, same as Nubbles. But it can be hard to find the time to work on these projects, as I have a full time job as well. One of the main problems is focus, only working on the project in fairly random bursts after fairly random intervals means I can never get any kind of flow going. I can never remember where I'm up to (even though I always leave myself copious notes), so I tend to spend the first twenty minutes trying to remember what I did last, what's left to do, and why it doesn't compile.

But, it's finally done, play-tested (a bit) and released. So, without further ado, get yourself along to the Play Store and download it forth with!

Play it lots and click on adverts, I need to buy some new shoes...

Many thanks,
